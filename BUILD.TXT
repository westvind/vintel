You want to build Vintel on your own?

This is for windows users. Linux users can install the programs
and tools mostly using distribution's software management.


=================================================================

To run the source, you need:

* Python 2.7.x
  https://www.python.org/downloads/
  Vintel was not written for Python 3!

* PyQt4x
  http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download
  Please use the PyQt Binary Package for Py2.7
  Vintel was not written for PyQt5!

* BeautifulSoup 4
  https://pypi.python.org/pypi/beautifulsoup4

* pygame 1.9.1 (for python 2.7)
  http://pygame.org/download.shtml
  pygame is used to play the sound: If it is not available the
  soundoption will be disabled.

=================================================================

How to set up an development directory:


- Download and install Python 2.7 from the link above

- Downlad and install PyQt from the link above

- If you installed Python 2.7.9 (or newer) pip is installed
  with it. Pip is an package manager for Python.
  Use it to install BeautifulSoup4:
  pip install BeautifulSoup4

* If you want sound support, download and install pygame from
  the link above.

Now you are able to start the vintel.py.

Hot to create the standalone exe?

The standalone exe is created using pyinstaller.
All media files and the .spec-file with the configuration for
pyinstaller are included in the source-archive.
